Feature Engineering Pipeline
=============================
Mirrors the two-tier feature pattern used by Uber Michelangelo and Salesforce Einstein:
- Behavioral engagement signals (product depth, session frequency, recency decay)
- Composite scores (engagement index, stickiness, support risk)
- Spend trend signals (order value trajectory, discount sensitivity)

All features are engineered from raw behavioral columns — no demographics used
as primary signals, mirroring industry best practice for fairness and signal quality.
