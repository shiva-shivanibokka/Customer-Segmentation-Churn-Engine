"""
LLM Retention Action Generator
================================
Converts SHAP-derived risk factors, uplift scores, and segment profiles
into structured, personalized retention strategies via Claude.

This mirrors how Salesforce Einstein and HubSpot use LLMs to generate
CSM (Customer Success Manager) playbooks: the model doesn't just say
"this customer will churn" — it says "here's specifically what to do,
through which channel, with what message, at what cost, and why."

Architecture:
- Input: top SHAP features (WHY they're at risk), segment profile (WHO they are),
  churn probability, uplift score, CLV estimate, customer type classification
- Output: structured retention action with intervention type, channel,
  timing, message framing, estimated cost, and expected ROI reasoning

The prompt engineering pattern follows the "chain of thought + structured output"
approach used in enterprise AI products — forcing the LLM to reason through
the customer profile before generating the recommendation.

Your role is to analyze at-risk customer profiles and generate specific, actionable retention strategies.

## Customer Profile

**Segment:** {segment} ({seg_size} customers in this segment, {seg_churn_rate:.1%} average churn rate)
**Risk Tier:** {risk_tier} | **Churn Probability:** {churn_prob:.1%}
**Uplift Score:** {uplift:+.3f} (positive = responds to intervention, negative = does not)
**Customer Type:** {customer_type}
**Estimated Intervention ROI:** ${net_roi:.2f} (based on ${avg_clv:.0f} estimated CLV)

## Customer Behavior

- Tenure with platform: {tenure:.0f} months
- Satisfaction score: {satisfaction}/5 (1=satisfied, 5=very dissatisfied)
- Filed a complaint recently: {"Yes" if complain else "No"}
- Hours spent on app (last period): {hours_on_app:.1f} hours
- Days since last order: {days_since_order:.0f} days
- Total orders placed: {order_count:.0f}
- Cashback earned: ${cashback:.2f}
- Coupons used: {coupon_used:.0f}

## Top Risk Factors (SHAP Analysis)

The following features are the primary drivers of this customer's churn risk.
Positive SHAP values increase churn risk; negative values decrease it:

{shap_str}

## Segment Context

This customer belongs to the **{segment}** segment:
- Average engagement score: {seg_engagement:.2f}/1.0
- Average recency signal: {seg_recency:.2f} (higher = less recent purchases)
- Historical churn rate in this segment: {seg_churn_rate:.1%}

## Your Task

Based on the above profile, generate a structured retention action plan.
Think step by step:

1. What is the PRIMARY reason this customer is at risk? (based on SHAP analysis)
2. What does the Customer Type classification ({customer_type}) tell us about their receptivity to intervention?
3. What is the most appropriate intervention given their segment and risk drivers?
4. What is the optimal channel and timing?
5. What specific message framing will resonate with this customer's profile?

Output your response in the following JSON format ONLY (no other text):

{{
  "primary_risk_reason": "One sentence describing the main churn driver",
  "customer_receptivity": "Brief assessment of whether intervention will work and why",
  "intervention_type": "One of: Discount Offer / Loyalty Reward / Personalized Content / Proactive Support Call / Reactivation Campaign / Premium Upgrade / Service Recovery",
  "channel": "One of: In-App Notification / Email / Push Notification / Direct Call / SMS",
  "timing": "One of: Immediate / Within 24 hours / Within 1 week / During next session",
  "message_framing": "2-3 sentence customer-facing message (do not mention ML or churn prediction)",
  "intervention_cost_estimate": "Low ($1-5) / Medium ($10-25) / High ($50-100)",
  "expected_outcome": "Brief prediction of what happens if this intervention is executed",
  "confidence": "High / Medium / Low",
  "do_not_intervene_reason": null
}}

If the Customer Type is 'Lost Cause' or 'Sleeping Dog', set all fields to null and populate 'do_not_intervene_reason' explaining why intervention would be counterproductive.
